======================================
June 2, 2014
	Julia: Claire and I both planned out the project and what order we would tackle our goals in.
	
June 3, 2014
	Julia: I created an Assignment class that we could add to later as needed. I also wrote the README.md file.
	Claire: Created the repository.

June 4, 2014
	Julia: Created the DueDate class.
	Claire: Created the Planner class and wrote a few methods, however my github was messed up so I had to reclone the repository and I lost this version of the file. This is why it doesn't show up in the github history.

	Julia:
	Claire:Created the Backpack class, which is essentially the umbrella class of the whole project. There is an array of all the assignments contained in the backpack, and the Planner will be a priority queue-type data structure that is like a to-do list. Added basic methods to Backpack.
