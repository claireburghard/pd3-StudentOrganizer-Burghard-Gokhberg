======================================
June 2, 2014
	Julia: Claire and I both planned out the project and what order we would tackle our goals in.
	
June 3, 2014
	Julia: I created an Assignment class that we could add to later as needed. I also wrote the README.md file.
	Claire: Created the repository.

June 4, 2014
	Julia: Created the DueDate class.
	Claire: Created the Planner class and wrote a few methods, however my github was messed up so I had to reclone the repository and I lost this version of the file. This is why it doesn't show up in the github history.
	
June 6, 2014
	Julia: Editted what Claire did in class and added a complete method to the Backpack.
	Claire:Created the Backpack class, which is essentially the umbrella class of the whole project. There is an array of all the assignments contained in the backpack, and the Planner will be a priority queue-type data structure that is like a to-do list. Added basic methods to Backpack. 

June 8, 2014
	Julia: Started the ToDo List.
	Claire:
		1) To make up for yesterday: fixed some of Julia's methods in the ToDoList class (some of the parameters were off/there were some methods that needed adjustments.
		2) edited the DueDate class so that due dates can be compared based on how many minutes they add up to (totalMinutes() method). Added a method to the ToDoList class that allows you to add an assignment to the toDoList in the proper place based on its due date. 
		
June 9, 2014
	Julia: 1) Fixed a few bugs in the Node and DueDate classes.
	TOGETHER: In class, we used Julia's computer to fix bugs in the code together using pair programming.
