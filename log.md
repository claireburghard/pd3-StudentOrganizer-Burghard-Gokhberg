======================================
June 2, 2014
	*JULIA: Claire and I both planned out the project and what order we would tackle our goals in.
	
June 3, 2014
	*JULIA: I created an Assignment class that we could add to later as needed. I also wrote the README.md file.
	*CLAIRE: Created the repository.

June 4, 2014
	*JULIA: Created the DueDate class.
	*CLAIRE: Created the Planner class and wrote a few methods, however my github was messed up so I had to reclone the repository and I lost this version of the file. This is why it doesn't show up in the github history.
	
June 6, 2014
	*JULIA: Editted what Claire did in class and added a complete method to the Backpack.
	*CLAIRE: Created the Backpack class, which is essentially the umbrella class of the whole project. There is an array of all the assignments contained in the backpack, and the Planner will be a priority queue-type data structure that is like a to-do list. Added basic methods to Backpack. 

June 8, 2014
	*JULIA: Started the ToDo List.
	*CLAIRE:
		1) To make up for yesterday: fixed some of Julia's methods in the ToDoList class (some of the parameters were off/there were some methods that needed adjustments.
		2) edited the DueDate class so that due dates can be compared based on how many minutes they add up to (totalMinutes() method). Added a method to the ToDoList class that allows you to add an assignment to the toDoList in the proper place based on its due date. 
		
June 9, 2014
	*JULIA:  1) Fixed a few bugs in the Node and DueDate classes.
		2) Finished fixing about 10 non-typo bugs that were not allowing To Do List to compile. It now can compile smoothly.
	*TOGETHER: In class, we used Julia's computer to fix bugs in the code together using pair programming.

June 10, 2014
	*JULIA: 1) Started the user scanner file to make the program more interactive.
	*TOGETHER: Tried to get the code to put the program on the internet working, but to no avail.
	
June 11, 2014
	*JULIA: 1) Continued working on the user class. We need a way to be able to store people's information so that it does not get lost every time they exit the program.
