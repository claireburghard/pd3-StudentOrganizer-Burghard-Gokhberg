Description:
	We plan on creating a student planner in which there will be a “To Do” list in which assignments will be marked by their due date and whether they are completed or not. We also plan on creating flash cards as a study aid, and maybe even allowing students to write essays using the program.

Instructions:
	javac User.java,
	java User.
	
	MyBackpack.java contains instances of all other things and is the overarching file in the program.
	Planner and To Do List deal with assignments and their storage.
	The Deck deals with the Flashcards.
	The Serialization file covers the methods for Serialization.
	
	
What Works:
	Everything in the description is working.

	The User interface is the "Driver" of our program. Its a network of interactive activities that prompt the User through different activities which can be initiated through different parts of code.
	
	The individual pieces of the project can work well individually through their own individual Drivers.

What Doesn’t:
	We attempted to get this onto a webpage on the internet but it didn't work out.
	
	Despite our hours of debugging, there are some inevitable bugs in the program that cause runtime errors. (No 	compiling errors). However, all of the separate pieces of the code work correctly when run in their own individual Drivers.

Data Structures & Highlights:
	Priority Queue
	Serialization
	Opening files and writing in them from the program
